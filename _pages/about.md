Hi, I'm SangHo, a junior majoring **Computer Science & Engineering**(CSE), **Artificial Intelligence** (AI), and **Political Science & International Relations**(PSIR) at Sunkyunkwan University (SKKU).

I am currently doing research at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) as an exchange student advised by [Prof. Georgios Pavlakos](https://geopavlakos.github.io/) and co-advised by [Prof. Kristen Grauman](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/).

**My research Interests** are in **Social Interaction Modeling** with a broader focus in Artificial Social Intelligence (ASI) and Multimodal Machine Learning.

Before my time at UT, I had a wonderful time with [Prof. Sangmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/sangmin-lee/home) studying Social Intelligence at SKKU during my sophomore year. Before that, I interned at Seoul National University [Code Lab](https://codelab.snu.ac.kr/), advised by [Prof. Hyojin Sung](https://codelab.snu.ac.kr/people) during my freshman year.

I'm also the Founder of [SungKyunKwan AI (SKKAI)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/skkai-sungkyunkwan-ai/), officially supported by the College of Computing & Informatics and SungKyun Artificial Intelligence Research Institute.

I'm also a ex-Staff Sergeant from R.O.K. Air Force Operations Command Joint Systems branch(Comms), where I worked with the United States 7th Air Force at Osan Air Base. My proposals there were recognized by the Chief of Command and Palantir.
